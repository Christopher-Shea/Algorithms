# Algorithms
This is a collection of solutions to algorithmic puzzles I have particularly enjoyed, written in JavaScript.
Some puzzles have multiple solutions provided.
Solutions are annotated with explanations of the logic used.
Each solution has its own readme with contextual notes (constraints, inputs, output) and any additional thoughts.

## How to use
Each solution is followed by a few invocations (and the expected output).

The solution can be run in the browser developer tools. If using Chrome, the code can be run as a snippet, or copied directly into the console.

If node is installed, the program can be run in the shell.
For example, working from the coinSums folder, the coinSums solution can be run:
```
node coinSums_solution.js
```
