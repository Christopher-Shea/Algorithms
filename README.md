# Algorithms
This is a collection of solutions to algorithmic puzzles I have particularly enjoyed, written in JavaScript. Each solution has its own readme with contextual notes (constraints, inputs, output) and any additional thoughts I might have.

## How to use
Each solution is followed by a few invocations (accompanied by the expected output)

The solution can be run in the browser developer tools. If using Chrome, the code can be run as a snippet, or copied directly into the console.

If node is installed, the program can be run in the shell

```
node [solution filename]
```
