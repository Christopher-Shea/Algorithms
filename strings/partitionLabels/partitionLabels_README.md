# Description
Given a string, return the lengths of the smallest number of partitions such that each distinct character in the string is contaied in a single partition.

For example, the string

```
'asvdssccavcvsdxryqzrqpzryprxghonogojklgh'
```

will be split into the following partitions

```
'asvdssccavcvsd', 'xryqzrqpzryprx', 'ghonogojklgh'
```

and the result will be

```
[14, 14, 12]
```

## Constraints
Should be able to handle an empty string

## Input
A string to be partitioned

## Output
An array of integers representing the length of the partitions
