## Description
Imagine a two-dimensional world in which buildings (and the gound they exist on top of) are made of a totally impermeable material. When it rains, water collects in the spaces created between buildings. Given an array that represents the heights of these buildings, what is the maximum amount of water than can be collected after a period of heavy rainfall?

For example, [6, 0, 5, 3, 0, 3, 3] will produce the following scene:
```
 __
|  |   __
|  |//|  |
|  |//|  |__    __ __
|  |//|  |  |//|  |  |
|  |//|  |  |//|  |  |
|  |//|  |  |//|  |  |
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
```
8 units of water will be collected.

## Constraints
None

## Input
An array of height values

## Output
The number of water units collected after heavy rainfall
