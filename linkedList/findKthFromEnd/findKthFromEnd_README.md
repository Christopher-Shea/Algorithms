# Description
Write a program to find the value of the node 'k' spots from the end of a singly-linked list.

Given the following list:

```
{a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f -> g}
```

the tail, 'g', is 1 spot from the end of the list.
the head, 'a', is 7 (the length of the list) spots from the end of the list.
'e' is 3 spots from the end of the list.

## Constraints
An empty list will return null.
A value of k = 0 will return null.
A value of k greater than the length of the list will return null.

## Input
A singly-linked list

## Output
The value found k nodes from the end of the list

## Additional Notes
This is similar to the solution for 'insertKthFromEnd'.
