# Description
Given two linked lists with values representing the digits of non-negative integers in reverse order, return a list with digits representing the sum of the two lists.

For example,

```
{1 -> 4 -> 8 -> 3} and {7 -> 6 -> 0 -> 7} represent the numbers 3,841 and 7,067
```

```
and the sum is 10,908 {8 -> 0 -> 9 -> 0 -> 1}
```

## Constraints

## Input
Two singly linked lists

## Output
A list representing the sum of the two lists

## Additional Notes
Have provided an optional parameter that can indicate the digits are stored in forward order.
