# Description
Write a program to reverse a singly-linked list.

```
{1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> null}
```

reversed:

```
{7 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> null}
```

## Constraints
The list is singly linked.
If possible, do not use any additional memory.

## Input
A singly-linked list

## Output
The input list in reverse

## Additional Notes
Two solutions - one solution uses a stack to temporarily store the values of the node, the other reverses the list in place.
