# Description
Write a program to remove duplicates from a singly linked list.

Given the following list:

```
{a -> b -> c -> d -> b -> e -> f -> a -> g -> h -> c -> i -> b -> j -> k -> f}

```
the list returned without duplicates will be:

```
{a -> b -> c -> d -> e -> f -> g -> h -> i -> j -> k}
```


## Constraints
Should be able to handle empty lists.

## Input
A singly-linked list

## Output
The list with duplicates removed

## Additional Notes
This can either be done with O(1) space or O(n) time, but not both
