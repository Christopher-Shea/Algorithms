# Description
Write a program to find the intersecton point of two linked lists and return a reference to that node.

Given the following lists:

```
{a -> b -> c -> d -> 
                     e -> f -> g}
     {j -> k -> l ->
```

return {e -> f -> g}

## Constraints
If the lists do not intersect, return null.

## Input
Two singly-linked lists

## Output
The node where the input lists intersect
